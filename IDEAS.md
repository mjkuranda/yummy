# Ideas

## Missing features

-   Validation - client side: The patterns should be loaded from pattern file? Or simply embedeed inside elements.
-   Error page for multer and other errors while you are trying to add a new meal.
-   6 meals in `/search` should be removed in a near future.
-   Edition of existing meals - you can edit anything you want apart from the title - because it occurs as the name.
-   Each result has a property called `relevance` - could be measured as a percentage. The found results should be sorted according to the this property.
-   Better handling MongoDB errors - types of errors and their communicates.
-   Improved README and guide for developers how to add ingredients and other things.

## Bugs
